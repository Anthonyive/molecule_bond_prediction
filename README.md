# Description of this repo
The goal of this repo is to ...
This demo is based on the Kaggle competition 'Predicting Molecular Properties' (Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/overview) where the task is to predict the bond strength between atoms in molecules.

The repo contains the following:

* notebooks: main repository with the notebooks for feature creation and model fitting/testing
* code: directory with additional code (e.g. to create the non-TDA features)
* data: directory to store the data from Kaggle (download from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/data)
* README.md
